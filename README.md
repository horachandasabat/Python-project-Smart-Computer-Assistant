# Python-project-Smart-Computer-Assistant
The Smart Computer Assistant is a Python-based project designed to simplify and enhance the user experience by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent responses to queries. Built using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, this assistant can understand and process user commands, manage schedules, set reminders, and retrieve information from the web.

The project leverages libraries like NLTK for language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and SpeechRecognition for voice input. The assistant is capable of learning from user interactions, gradually adapting to preferences and providing more personalized suggestions. It also integrates with various APIs, enabling seamless communication with other applications and services, making it a versatile tool for productivity and daily task management.
